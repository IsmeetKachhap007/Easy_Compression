# Easy Compression 

**Easy Compression** is a super easy-to-use online image compression tool. Simply upload your desired image(s), and Easy Compression will automatically perform its compress functionality and provide details on the results. Users can also customize features to suite their desired output, such as setting the output format or number of output colors. It's intuitive, website and mobile friendly, and supports compression configuration. At the same time, because of purely local compression without any server-side logic, it is completely safe.
